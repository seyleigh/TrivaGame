# TrivaGame

Just your basic triva game. Four choices - select whichever you believe to be right. You have 30 seconds to make your decision. If you dont choose in time it will count as wrong and move on to the next question. 

Eight questions in all- you can try as many times as you want without having to refresh the page. Refreshing the page will wipe everything out and make you start over.
